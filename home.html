          <p>My name is Brock Carpani and I am currently a Junior at Kansas State University with a 3.828 GPA
              studying Computer Science (May 2020 expected graduation).<br><br>Over the last couple of years, I personally have developed and published three games on the iOS App
              store, and I continue to develop new games and applications during my free time. Last summer
              I had the privilege of an internship on the Web Development team at The Container Store
              headquarters in the Dallas area.<br><br>During high school I competed in online and LAN events for the game Call of Duty. During these
              events I competed against pro and other amateur teams. I had the best time, not only competing,
              but experiencing the atmosphere of these events. I still constantly watch the pros&#39; streams and
              videos, tournaments, and play all kinds of games. Based on the great experience I had, I want to give
              that same or an even better experience to gamers as a career, whether through esports, creating a
              game which people can dive into and enjoy themselves, or building the development platform for
              others through video game development with my knowledge of computer science.
